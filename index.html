      Happy Birthday, Ashish.
I still remember the first time we had a video call. I actually blushed when I heard your deep, manly voice. It’s funny because I was just casually looking for timepass on Telegram back then, and then you texted me personally. One thing led to another, and we shifted from Telegram to WhatsApp.
I also remember how I used to reply after three or four hours because you were in my locked chats and I kept forgetting. Slowly, though, I started feeling a connection with you. And then, like an idiot, I told myself, “It’s time to ghost this guy. I’m done.” I even tried to do it.
You had just shifted to a new room, then you went back home, and we didn’t talk for three days. By then, I was already too attached — more than I can explain in words. I even had a slight fever, probably because I felt guilty that the conversation had stopped because of me. I kept checking WhatsApp again and again, watching when you came online and when you left — basically stalking you.
Then one afternoon, you called me. And just like that, we started talking again. That was the moment I realized I didn’t want to lose you. Still, I tried to ghost you a few more times, even though the truth was that I had started loving you.
Today, with a clear mind and an honest heart, I want to say this out loud:
I love you deeply. My day begins with you and ends with you. You feel like home to me.
I love you, cutu.
